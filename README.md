# Fizz Buzz - For smart programmers
So you're in a job interview, and the interviewer asks you to write a '[fizz buzz generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc)'.
What would a good developer do? A novice developer writes 80 lines of code, an experienced developer
would write 20, but **you**? You're smart. You install it using PIP, and write three lines of code.

## Installation
This will be the hardest part of your interview, execute the following command:

```
$ pip install fizz-buzz
```

## Usage
This is where the magic happens

```python
# Don't forget to write comments. Interviewers LOVE comments. 
# Doesn't even matter if they're meaningful!
from fizz_buzz import fizz_buzz


# Such fizz, very buzz
for fizz in fizz_buzz(amount=100):
    print(fizz)
```

## License
I'm not responsible if you don't get the job, albeit if they reject you for this you most likely dodged a bullet as they
are probably total idiots and you would have been miserable working there. If anything, you should thank me with some free coffee!
<sup>(Yes, I'm shamelessly begging for coffee)</sup>
